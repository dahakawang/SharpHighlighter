# SharpHighlighter
SharpHighlighter is a syntax highlighter written in C++, and is aimed to be compatible with Linux, OS X and iOS.

When talking about implementing a syntax highlighter, the most challenging thing isn't writing a parser that can recognize a specific language, but is the numerous languages you have to support. I don't want to learn 100 languages myself to implement a syntax highlighter, so I plan to use existing things out there. 

SharpHighlighter uses a compatible language definition syntax with TextMate (Sublime, Atom as well). And now the library is almost usable, next step is to add more tests to the core componenet.
