# SharpHighlighter
SharpHighlighter is a syntax highlighter written in objective-c, and is aimed to be compatible with iOS and OS X.

When talking about implementing a syntax highlighter, the most challenging thing isn't writing a parser that can recognize a specific language, but is the numerous language syntax definition files you have to write.I don't want to learn 100 language myself to implement those syntax definition files, so I plan to use existing things out there. 

SharpHighlighter uses a compatible language definition grammar with TextMate (Sublime as well). My goal is to provide a compatible parser that can understand the same thing. Hopefully this project can be in beta status by mid 2015 ;-)
